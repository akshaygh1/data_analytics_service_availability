Service Availability

Service refers to any group of server or virtual machine or container providing specific functionality. Service availability is an extension of high availability of individual servers/virtual machines/containers, referring to services that are available regardless of hardware/software or user fault.

Key principles of service availability:	
•	Redundancy – "backup" capability in case of need to failover due to a fault
•	Stateful and seamless recovery from failures
•	Minimization of mean time to repair (MTTR) – time to restore service after an outage
•	Fault prediction & avoidance – take action before something fails
